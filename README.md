# Progress (Week 3/28)

* Harrison Kelly
    * Fixed a UI caching issue and stubbed out the async calls for the new REST api. Also
    made a slight modification to the REST api and connected the /getLatestInventory/ call.
    * Got rid of the unused icons and changed the ordering of the Latest Inventory so that
    it was actually the latest and not the first three items, also changed the ordering of the Inventory
    to show the latest at the top.
